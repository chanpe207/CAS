This is a privately used Github repository for Industrial Robotics Assignment 2

Requirements:
Matlab r2022a or above
Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox
Raspberry Pi or Linux if using real UR3

To run the simulations:
1. Run Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox in Matlab
2. Open the RunSimulation.m script
3. Run the first section to set up the workspace
4. Run the second section and use GUI tools to run simulation

To run the real UR3
1. Run Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox in Matlab
2. Follow the instructions on setting up the real UR3 in the following link https://canvas.uts.edu.au/courses/24758/pages/instructions-for-using-a-real-ur3
3. Open the RunRealUR3.m script
4. Run the first section to set up the workspace
5. Run the second section and use GUI tools to run check for collisions in simulation before running real robot
6. Run third section to run real UR3
